      <hotspot description="This sophisticated and characterful venue, set right on the Pierhead of the V&amp;A Waterfront, has sweeping views of the harbour, the city and the mountain.&#xa;It was built in 1904 as the North Quay Warehouse, and converted in 1990 to a 94-room luxury hotel. It is popular with guests and there is a very good reason why it is often called ‘Your home in the heart of the Waterfront’. &#xa;The ambience of colonial Cape Town is apparent as you step into the foyer, and historical touches abound, such as the information on various shipwrecks around the Cape coast. The hotel has two restaurants and a bar with outstanding views of the mountain and the harbour, as well as excellent spa facilities. It is renowned for its high level of service to both business and leisure travellers, and guests can make use of the travel consultancy, the valet service, a childminding service, a secretarial service and hotel transfer services. &#xa;It is a favourite location for business and private functions. The superb harbour location puts guests right in the middle of all the attractions, shops and eateries of the Waterfront.&#xa;&#xa;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newmarkhotels.com/places/hotels/victoria-alfred-hotel/&quot;> https://newmarkhotels.com/places/hotels/victoria-alfred-hotel/&lt;/a>" title="Victoria &amp; Alfred Hotel" id="Point03" pan="-35.86" target="" tilt="-2.36" url="" skinid="ht_hotel"/>

      <hotspot description="This sophisticated and characterful venue, set right on the Pierhead of the V&amp;A Waterfront, has sweeping views of the harbour, the city and the mountain.It was built in 1904 as the North Quay Warehouse, and converted in 1990 to a 94-room luxury hotel. It is popular with guests and there is a very good reason why it is often called ‘Your home in the heart of the Waterfront’. The ambience of colonial Cape Town is apparent as you step into the foyer, and historical touches abound, such as the information on various shipwrecks around the Cape coast. The hotel has two restaurants and a bar with outstanding views of the mountain and the harbour, as well as excellent spa facilities. It is renowned for its high level of service to both business and leisure travellers, and guests can make use of the travel consultancy, the valet service, a childminding service, a secretarial service and hotel transfer services. It is a favourite location for business and private functions. The superb harbour location puts guests right in the middle of all the attractions, shops and eateries of the Waterfront. &#xa;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vahotel.co.za/&#xa;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://www.vahotel.co.za/&#xa;&lt;/a>" title="" id="Point04" pan="-357.39" target="" tilt="0.53" url="" skinid="ht_info"/>

The the use of material&#xa;and kinetic qualities activated by the viewer implies that the work can only fully be experienced when viewers are participating. Each viewer will experience the work differently allowing the work to transform in meaning and nature.&#xa;The work which absorbs, reflects and produces light is a meditative allowance – a time-out zone as a moment to escape, reboot and re-centre for both big and little. There is something magical about light activated by touch, and one&#xa;becomes particularly aware in interacting with A(non). The works stand as&#xa;shrines or sanctuaries in their collective solitudes. Strange domes to step under&#xa;and be transported into a different galaxy within which the experience is entirely your own.&#xa;A(non) is a seductive, playful and mesmerising piece, designed for a universal&#xa;platform of experience and understanding- something I believe there is much to&#xa;little of." title="a (non) | everything your heart desires " id="Point03" pan="-165.67" target="" tilt="1.09" url="" skinid="ht_info"/>

      <hotspot description="Marco Cianfanelli - 2019&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;Marco Cianfanelli’s previous explorations of the human brain as form, find new dimension in an exploratory series of digitally altered brain-like objects.&#xa;At the base of our brain, we hold the primal information of our ancestry; it is the living mechanism by which we are innately linked to our past. The faceted forms of the object are geometric distillations of the brain’s vast, organic topography. The geometric brain is a symbol that embodies the human desire to identify categorically and represent symbolically, an unquantifiable flux of information. &#xa;Condensing the intricacy of the organ into reduced, geometric forms allows it to adopt the appearance of a Paleolithic stone implement. In its materiality, the form points to a duality between progress and destruction inherent in technological advancement. More than implement, the form is an artifact of the present and whether viewed as a large feature in the landscape, or an implement of survival, it conjures the past and hypothesizes a future trajectory. It speaks to the collection of significant historical artifacts and marks our technological evolution, locating us in time and suggesting that our greatest and yet most dangerous tool is, in fact, our brain.&#xa;" title="Cerebral Aspects&#xa;" id="Point02" pan="-0.96" target="" tilt="0.21" url="" skinid="ht_info"/>
