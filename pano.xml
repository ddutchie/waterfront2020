      <hotspot skinid="ht_hotel" url="" pan="-35.28" description="This sophisticated and characterful venue, set right on the Pierhead of the V&amp;A Waterfront, has sweeping views of the harbour, the city and the mountain.&#xa;It was built in 1904 as the North Quay Warehouse, and converted in 1990 to a 94-room luxury hotel. It is popular with guests and there is a very good reason why it is often called ‘Your home in the heart of the Waterfront’. &#xa;The ambience of colonial Cape Town is apparent as you step into the foyer, and historical touches abound, such as the information on various shipwrecks around the Cape coast. The hotel has two restaurants and a bar with outstanding views of the mountain and the harbour, as well as excellent spa facilities. It is renowned for its high level of service to both business and leisure travellers, and guests can make use of the travel consultancy, the valet service, a childminding service, a secretarial service and hotel transfer services. &#xa;It is a favourite location for business and private functions. The superb harbour location puts guests right in the middle of all the attractions, shops and eateries of the Waterfront.&#xa;&#xa;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newmarkhotels.com/places/hotels/victoria-alfred-hotel/&quot;> https://newmarkhotels.com/places/hotels/victoria-alfred-hotel/&lt;/a>" target="" id="Point03" tilt="-2.43" title="Victoria &amp; Alfred Hotel"/>

It is popular with guests and there is a very good reason why it is often called ‘Your home in the heart of the Waterfront’. The ambience of colonial Cape Town is apparent as you step into the foyer, and historical touches abound, such as the information on various shipwrecks around the Cape coast. The hotel has two restaurants and a bar with outstanding views of the mountain and the harbour, as well as excellent spa facilities. It is renowned for its high level of service to both business and leisure travellers, and guests can make use of the travel consultancy, the valet service, a childminding service, a secretarial service and hotel transfer services. It is a favourite location for business and private functions. The superb harbour location puts guests right in the middle of all the attractions, shops and eateries of the Waterfront. &#xa;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vahotel.co.za/&#xa;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://www.vahotel.co.za/&#xa;&lt;/a>" target="" id="Point04" tilt="0.53" title=""/>
